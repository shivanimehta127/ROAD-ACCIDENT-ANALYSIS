# ROAD-ACCIDENT-ANALYSIS

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize road accident data. The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights into road safety trends, contributing factors, and accident severity to support decision-making by policymakers, researchers, and safety advocates.

## Overview
Road safety remains a critical concern globally. This Power BI dashboard provides a detailed analysis of road accident data with key visualizations and insights. It includes data on total casualties, accident types, road conditions, vehicle involvement, and more.

The interactive and user-friendly design allows stakeholders to explore patterns and trends, enabling them to take informed actions to improve road safety.
